Zen of Python, Tim Peters (Key Concepts Only)
     1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
        Embrace the notion that code can be beautiful and elegent.

     3. Simple is better than complex.
        When there is a choice between two working solutions, choose
        the simple solution instead of the complex solution.

     4. Complex is better than complicated.
        When a simple solution is unattainable, choose the simplest
        of the complex solutions.

     7. Readability counts
        Even when code is complex, aim to make readable by writing
        informative comments.

    12. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
        Nuts and bolts of your code should be readable to other
        programmers.

    15. Now is better than never.
        Do not try to write perfect code. Write code that works
        and then decide whether to improve your code or not.

     1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
     2. Explicit is better than implicit.
     3. Simple is better than complex.
     4. Complex is better than complicated.
     5. Flat is better than nested.
     6. Sparse is better than dense.
     7. Readability counts.
     8. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
     9. Although practicality beats purity.
    10. Errors should never pass silently.
    11. Unless explicitly silenced.
    12. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    13. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    14. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    15. Now is better than never.
    16. Although never is often better than *right* now.
    17. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    18. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    19. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
