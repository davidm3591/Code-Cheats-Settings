If you have GitHub Desktop installed, you can use it to clone repositories and not deal with SSH keys.

    Ensure the ssh-agent is running. You can use the "Auto-launching the ssh-agent" instructions in "Working with SSH key passphrases", or start it manually:

    # start the ssh-agent in the background
    $ eval `ssh-agent -s`
    > Agent pid 59566



Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_ed25519 in the command with the name of your private key file.

$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
